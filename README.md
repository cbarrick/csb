My deep learning toys.

This repository hosts my deep learning toy projects. It's divided into two parts: the library and the demos. The library is a collection of tools for working with TensorFlow and OpenAI tools. Its core is a framework for organizing TensorFlow models based on the [graph-property design of Danijar Hafner][design].
