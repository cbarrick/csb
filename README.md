My machine learning helper library and toys.

This repository hosts my machine learning library and toy projects. The library is a tiny set of tools and conventions for tying together the various big ML libraries like TensorFlow, the OpenAI Gym, and Scikit-learn.


## The Library
The primary contribution is a framework for organizing TensorFlow models based on the [graph-property design of Danijar Hafner][design].
